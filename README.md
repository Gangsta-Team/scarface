## Modification Files
When you first launch the Game with the ASI a folder in `%appdata%` <br> will be created called `%appdata%/Gangsta`. In there will be Files called `config.json` and `log.txt`. <br>In `log.txt`when logging enabled will be every Log Entry in the Console saved! But `config.json` on the other<br>hand is a little bit more complicated.<br>
### Example of config.json
 ```json
 {
"DebugConsole": false,
"ImGuiTextSize": 20.0, // Original is 16.f
"Log": false, // Not used for now
"ReleaseMode": false, // Default false -> spoofs your Game into Dev Mode
"WindowedSpoof": true // if on true your game will be forces into a borderless window mode!
}
```
